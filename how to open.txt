If you download a Laravel project from Git, there are several steps you need to follow to set it up and run it locally. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. Download the Project
Clone the Repository:
Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone <repository-url>
Replace <repository-url> with the URL of the Git repository.

Navigate to the Project Directory:
cd <project-directory>
Replace <project-directory> with the name of the directory where the project was cloned.



2. Install Dependencies
Ensure Composer is Installed:
Composer is required to manage PHP dependencies. If you don't have Composer installed, download and install it from getcomposer.org.

Install Laravel Dependencies:
Inside the project directory, run:
                                                =====>composer install<=====
This command will install all the PHP dependencies required by the Laravel project.



3. Setup Environment Configuration
Copy the .env.example file to .env:
The .env file contains the environment configuration for your Laravel application.

						=====>cp .env.example .env<=====

If you are on Windows, use:
						=====>copy .env.example .env<===== (you can manually change it by rename .env.example to only .env)

Generate the Application Key:
Laravel uses an application key for various security purposes. You need to generate this key by running:
php artisan key:generate
This command will set the APP_KEY value in your .env file.




4. Configure the Database
Open the .env file:
           		Edit the .env file and configure your database connection settings (like DB_DATABASE, DB_USERNAME, DB_PASSWORD, etc.).

Run Migrations:
To set up the database schema, run:
						=====>php artisan migrate<=====
This command will create the necessary tables in your database.



5. Run the Project
Start the Development Server:
To run your Laravel project locally, you can use the built-in PHP development server:
						=====>php artisan serve<=====
The project will be accessible at http://localhost:8000 by default.
